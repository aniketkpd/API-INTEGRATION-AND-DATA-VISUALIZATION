# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

This project fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities and visualizes it using Python. The data is sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather information for specified cities. The project demonstrates how to interact with APIs, process data, and present results through visualizations.

The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather data for cities such as Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bangalore. It fetches essential weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame for easy processing and comparison. The temperature is converted from Kelvin to Celsius for better readability. The project visualizes the weather data for all cities using bar charts to compare the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each city.

The visualization is done using the matplotlib library, which helps create clear and informative bar charts. These charts allow users to easily compare weather factors across different cities.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: The main programming language used for the project.
Requests: To make HTTP requests and fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Pandas: To handle and store the weather data in a DataFrame.
Matplotlib: To visualize the weather data with bar plots.
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for the cities.
Resources Used:

OpenWeatherMap API: The primary source for fetching real-time weather data for different cities.
ChatGPT: Used to help understand API integration, data processing, and visualization techniques.
YouTube: A valuable resource for understanding how to use APIs, especially for working with OpenWeatherMap.
W3Schools: Helped in learning the syntax and usage of Python libraries like requests, pandas, and matplotlib.
Output: The output of this project is a series of bar charts that display the weather data for each city. Each chart compares one weather factor (temperature, humidity, or wind speed) across all the cities. The temperature is shown in Celsius, humidity in percentage, and wind speed in meters per second. This allows users to easily compare and analyze the weather conditions of different cities. The use of colors in the bar charts further enhances the clarity and visual appeal of the results.
